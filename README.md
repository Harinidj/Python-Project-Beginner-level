Python Beginner Level Projects
Hey there! This repo has some of the simple Python project I made while learning the basics. Each file is a small program that does something fun or useful using beginner-level logic. 

📁 Projects in This Repo:
1. simple calculator.py

Add

Subtract

Multiply

It takes input from the user and gives the result based on the operation you choose.
